It includes a new version of every song on Fearless Platinum Edition, along with standalone single \u201cToday Was a Fairytale\u201d and six songs she cut from the original 2008 Fearless album.\n\nOn February 11, 2021, Swift appeared on Good Morning America to announce her re-recording of \u201cLove Story\u201d, which came out that night at midnight, and Fearless.\n\nLater that morning, Swift posted a letter to fans on Instagram, thanking them for their support and expressing her excitement about the project.  For her first five albums, she left hidden notes via capitalized letters in her album booklets, and she continued this tradition to hide the message \u201cApril Ninth\u201d in the note, revealing the release date.",

I don't know what to think\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said\n\"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone\nI love you and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'\"\n\n[Outro]\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

Please, tell me\n'Cause, one second, it was perfect\nNow you're halfway out the door\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said, \"Forever and always,\" oh\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWas I out of line?\nDid I say somethin' way too honest, made you run and hide\nLike a scared little boy?\nI looked into your eyes\nThought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure\nSo here's to everything coming down to nothin'\nHere's to silence that cuts me to the core\nWhere is this going?\nThought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said, \"Forever and always,\" oh\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou didn't mean it, baby\nI don't think so\nOh, woah\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, back up, baby, back up\nDid you forget everything?\nBack up, baby, back up\nDid you forget everything?\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\nOh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all\nAnd you flashback to when we said, \"Forever and always\"\nAnd it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\n\n[Outro]\nYou didn't mean it, baby\nYou said, \"Forever and always,\" yeah"

Please, tell me\n'Cause, one second, it was perfect\nNow you're halfway out the door\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said, \"Forever and always\"\nAnd it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWas I out of line?\nDid I say somethin' way too honest, made you run and hide\nLike a scared little boy?\nI looked into your eyes\nThought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure\nSo here's to everything coming down to nothing\nHere's to silence that cuts me to the core\nWhere is this going?\nThought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all\nYou flashback to when he said, \"Forever and always\"\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou didn't mean it, baby\nI don't think so\nOh, oh-woah\nOh, oh-oh\n\n[Bridge]\nBack up, baby, back up\nDid you forget everything?\nBack up, baby, back up\nDid you forget everything?\nBack up, baby, back up\nPlease, back up, oh, back up\nBack up, baby, back up\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all\nYou flashback to when we said, \"Forever and always\"\nAnd it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong\nIt rains when you're here, it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\n\n[Outro]\nYou didn't mean it, baby\nYou said, \"Forever and always,\" yeah"

I don't know what to think\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said\n\"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone\nI love you and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'\"\n\n[Outro]\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"
