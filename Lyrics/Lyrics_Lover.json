 "description_preview": "Swift\u2019s seventh studio album was her first release with Republic Records, after leaving Big Machine in November 2018. Fans began speculating about the album as early as February 2019, and Swift alluded to this in a speech at the 2019 iHeartRadio Music Awards the next month, saying that fans \u201cwill be the first to know\u201d about new music.\n\nSwift indirectly announced the record when she posted a thirteen-day countdown to social media, which was also featured on billboards in cities like New York and London. After posting the countdown, Swift posted new pictures to social media every day leading up to the release of the lead single, \u201cME!,\u201d featuring Brendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco on April 26th.\n\nActing as an elaborate Easter egg hunt, Swift hid hints about the album title, song titles, and lyrics throughout the music video.\n\nSwift announced the album and its August 23rd release date officially on June 13th during an Instagram livestream, as well as announcing the second single,  \u201cYou Need To Calm Down.\u201d\n\nThe full album tracklist was allegedly leaked by iTunes on August 14, two days before the title track \u201cLover\u201d was officially released. Two days later, Taylor Swift officially announced the tracklist in multiple Instagram posts, confirming what the leak had already revealed two days earlier.\n\nAfter just one day on sale, Lover became the top-selling 2019 album in the U.S., selling 450,000 copies in its first day alone. It later topped the Billboard 200 chart, with 867,000 total units in a week, becoming her sixth #1 album, having the biggest U.S. sales week since that of her 2017 project reputation, and earning the second-biggest streaming week for a female artist, behind Ariana Grande\u2019s thank u, next. On September 27th, 2019, the album was certified platinum.",

(You could be GLAAD)\nSunshine on the street at the parade\nBut you would rather be in the dark ages\nMakin' that sign must've taken all night\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace\nAnd control your urges to scream about all the people you hate\n'Cause shade never made anybody less gay\n\n[Chorus]\nSo oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\nYou need to calm down, you're being too loud\nAnd I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)\nYou need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?\nYou need to calm down\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd we see you over there on the internet\nComparing all the girls who are killing it\nBut we figured you out\nWe all know now we all got crowns\nYou need to calm down\n\n[Chorus]\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\nYou need to calm down (You need to calm down)\nYou're being too loud (You're being too loud)\nAnd I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)\nYou need to just stop (Can you stop?)\nLike can you just not step on our gowns?\nYou need to calm down"
