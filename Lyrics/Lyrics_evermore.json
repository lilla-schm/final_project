 "description_preview": "Taylor Swift\u2019s ninth studio album, evermore, was her second major release in 2020, arriving only five months after folklore. Swift has described the two albums as \u2018sister records,\u2019 with evermore serving as a continuation and further artistic venture into \u2018the forest of this music\u2019.\n\nIn contrast to Swift\u2019s usual structured and extensive album rollouts, evermore\u2013much like folklore\u2013was announced via social media sixteen hours prior to release. Shortly after the announcement, she explained her reasoning for surprising fans with another album:\n\nEver since I was 13, I\u2019ve been excited about turning 31 because it\u2019s my lucky number backwards, which is why I wanted to surprise you with this now. You\u2019ve all been so caring, supportive and thoughtful on my birthdays and so this time I thought I would give you something!\n\nSwift also dedicated evermore to people who turn to music in effort to \u2018cope with missing loved ones,\u2019 acknowledging the unusual loneliness of the 2020 winter holiday season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLike folklore, the writing on evermore was a collaborative effort between Swift, Aaron Dessner (of The National), Jack Antonoff, Joe Alwyn, and Bon Iver. The album is notable for containing three artist features (HAIM, The National, and Bon Iver), the most of any of Swift\u2019s studio records to date.\n\nA music video for the lead single, \u201cwillow,\u201d was released alongside the album at midnight on December 11, 2020.",

Well\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOoh\nI guess I'll never know\nOoh\nAnd you'll go on with the show\n\n[Chorus]\nBut it's never too late to come back to my side\nThe stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo\nAnd if you're ever tired of bein' known for who you know\nYou know, you'll always know me\nDorothea, uh-uh\nDorothea, ah-ah\n\n[Outro]\nOoh, ooh\nOoh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\nOoh, ooh\nOoh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh\nDorothea (Ah-ah-ah)\nAh-ah\nOoh"
