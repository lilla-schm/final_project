 "description_preview": "Three years after the release of 2014\u2019s 1989, and following several public spats with celebrities like Kanye West, Taylor Swift aims to clear her name and inaccurate public image on reputation. At a fan event that took place in June 2018, Swift described the record as a story of \u201cfinding love throughout all the noise,\u201d referring to how the album transitions from discussing her persona to falling in love with British actor Joe Alwyn.\n\nOn its first day alone, the album sold 700,000 physical copies, and it debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart, having sold more copies that week than the other 199 listed albums combined. Within a month, the record was certified triple platinum, becoming RIAA\u2019s top-certified album of the year, and even a year after its release, it was deemed the biggest album of 2018 on the Billboard charts.\n\nThe album was announced after Swift removed all previous social media presence and uploaded three videos of a snake\u2019s tail, body, and head in August 2017; most considered this a reference to the \u201csnake\u201d nickname she was given after it was revealed she wrote Calvin Harris' \u201cThis Is What You Came For\u201d after their breakup, which worsened during public fallouts with Kanye West and Katy Perry.\n\nTo promote the album, Swift teamed up with Target to produce two exclusive magazines which feature poetry, paintings, handwritten lyrics, and a behind-the-scenes look at the music video for lead single \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d She worked with UPS leading up to the album\u2019s release, and partnered with Ticketmaster to help dedicated fans be the first to score tickets to her 2018 tour.",

Oh\nAre you ready for it?\n\n[Refrain]\nBaby, let the games begin\nLet the games begin\nLet the games begin, ah-ah\nBaby, let the games begin\nLet the games begin\nLet the games begin\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI, I, I see how this is gon' go\nTouch me and you'll never be alone\nI-Island breeze and lights down low\nNo one has to know\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)\nYou should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), mmm (Yeah)\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)\nI know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time (Yeah)\nIn the middle of the night\n\n[Refrain]\nBaby, let the games begin\nLet the games begin\nLet the games begin\nAre you ready for it?\nBaby, let the games begin\nLet the games begin\nLet the games begin\nAre you ready for it?"

You're gorgeous\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou should take it as a compliment\nThat I'm talkin' to everyone here but you (But you, but you)\nAnd you should think about the consequence\nOf you touchin' my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)\nIf you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her\nBut if you're single, that's honestly worse\n'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOcean blue eyes lookin' in mine\nI feel like I might sink and drown and die\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're so gorgeous\nI can't say anything to your face (To your face)\n'Cause look at your face (Look at your face; Gorgeous)\nAnd I'm so furious\nAt you for makin' me feel this way (Feel this way)\nBut what can I say? You're gorgeous\n\n[Bridge]\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)\nThere's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)\nYou are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)\nThere's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)\nGuess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Ugh) alone\nUnless you wanna come along (Oh)\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're so gorgeous (Gorgeous)\nI can't say anything to your face (To your face)\n'Cause look at your face (Look at your face; Gorgeous)\nAnd I'm so furious (I'm so furious)\nAt you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)\nBut what can I say? (I say) You're gorgeous\n\n[Outro]\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)\nThere's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)\nYou are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)\nYou're gorgeous\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad (Turns back to sad)\nThere's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (What I can't have)\nYou are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)\nYou're gorgeous"

I\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets\nPicture of your face in an invisible locket\nYou said there was nothin' in the world that could stop it\nI had a bad feelin'\nAnd darlin', you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis\nPeople started talkin', puttin' us through our paces\nI knew there was no one in the world who could take it\nI had a bad feelin'\n\n[Chorus]\nBut we were dancin'\nDancin' with our hands tied, hands tied\nYeah, we were dancin'\nLike it was the first time, first time\nYeah, we were dancin'\nDancin' with our hands tied, hands tied\nYeah, we were dancin'\nAnd I had a bad feelin'\nBut we were dancin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nI, I loved you in spite of\nDeep fears that the world would divide us\nSo, baby, can we dance\nOh, through an avalanche? And\nSay, say that we got it\nI'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted\nOh, 'cause it's gravity\nOh, keeping you with me, I\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets\nPicture of your face in an invisible locket\nYou said there was nothin' in the world that could stop it\nI had a bad feelin'\n\n[Chorus]\nBut we were dancin'\nDancin' with our hands tied, hands tied\nYeah, we were dancin'\nLike it was the first time, first time\nYeah, we were dancin'\nDancin' with our hands tied, hands tied\nYeah, we were dancin' (Knew we had our hands tied)\nAnd I had a bad feelin'\nBut we were dancin'\n\n[Bridge]\nI'd kiss you as the lights went out\nSwayin' as the room burned down\nI'd hold you as the water rushes in\nIf I could dance with you again\nI'd kiss you as the lights went out\nSwayin' as the room burned down\nI'd hold you as the water rushes in\nIf I could dance with you again (Again, yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nDancin' with our hands tied, hands tied\nYeah, we were dancin' (Oh, yeah, we were dancin')\nLike it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)\nYeah, we were dancin' (Oh)\nDancin' with our hands tied, hands tied (Dancin' with our hands tied)\nYeah, we were dancin'\nAnd I had a bad feelin' (Had a bad feelin')\nBut we were dancin'\n\n[Outro]\nHands tied, hands tied\n(Dancin')"

    "lyrics": "Here's something I've learned about people.\nWe think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.\n\nThis is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.\n\nThe point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.\nWhen this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?\nLet me say it again, louder for those in the back...\nWe think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.\n\nThere will be no further explanation\n\nThere will be just reputation."
