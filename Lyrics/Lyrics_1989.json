 "description_preview": "1989 was Swift\u2019s official entrance to the pop music scene, and it cemented her status as a musical titan. It was the only album of 2014 to sell over a million copies in its first week, and spent five non-consecutive weeks at #1.\n\nAfter her 2012 record Red didn\u2019t win the Grammy for Album Of The Year, Swift stepped back and decided she may have a better chance if she changed her sound. That night, she vowed to go in a completely different direction in hopes that her next album would win the award \u2014 and it did, making Swift both the first woman to win the award twice and the first to win it for two genres, since her 2008 record, Fearless, won in 2010.\n\nSwift foreshadowed her new pop sound with 2013\u2019s \u201cSweeter Than Fiction,\u201d her first collaboration with Jack Antonoff, who became a crucial part of her pop career. He produced \u201cOut of the Woods,\u201d \u201cI Wish You Would,\u201d and deluxe track \u201cYou Are In Love,\u201d which Swift even wrote about his relationship with Lena Dunham.\n\nSwift kicked off the 1989 era with a livestream and the release of lead single \u201cShake It Off,\u201d which became one of her biggest hits and earned Swift her first diamond single by March 2020.\n\nSwift went on to release \u201cBlank Space,\u201d \u201cStyle,\u201d \u201cBad Blood,\u201d \u201cWildest Dreams,\u201d \u201cOut Of The Woods,\u201d and \u201cNew Romantics\u201d as singles. In addition, \u201cWelcome To New York\u201d was used in tourism ads for the city that served as the track\u2019s inspiration.\n\nIn addition to the standard, 13-song album, Swift teamed up with Target for an extended deluxe release, featuring three new songs and three voice memos from her writing sessions. A karaoke version of the album was also released for both the standard and the deluxe edition.\n\nIn May 2015, Swift kicked off the album\u2019s tour, sponsored by American Express. It became the highest-grossing U.S. tour of all time, earning over $250 million, and Swift later broke her own record with 2018\u2019s reputation Stadium Tour.",

It was the only album of 2014 to sell over a million copies in its first week, and spent five non-consecutive weeks at #1.\n\nAfter her 2012 record Red didn\u2019t win the Grammy for Album Of The Year, Swift stepped back and decided she may have a better chance if she changed her sound. That night, she vowed to go in a completely different direction in hopes that her next album would win the award \u2014 and it did, making Swift both the first woman to win the award twice and the first to win it for two genres, since her 2008 record, Fearless, won in 2010.\n\nSwift foreshadowed her new pop sound with 2013\u2019s \u201cSweeter Than Fiction,\u201d her first collaboration with Jack Antonoff, who became a crucial part of her pop career. He produced \u201cOut of the Woods,\u201d \u201cI Wish You Would,\u201d and deluxe track \u201cYou Are In Love,\u201d which Swift even wrote about his relationship with Lena Dunham.\n\nSwift kicked off the 1989 era with a livestream and the release of lead single \u201cShake It Off,\u201d which became one of her biggest hits and earned Swift her first diamond single by March 2020.\n\nSwift went on to release \u201cBlank Space,\u201d \u201cStyle,\u201d \u201cBad Blood,\u201d \u201cWildest Dreams,\u201d \u201cOut Of The Woods,\u201d and \u201cNew Romantics\u201d as singles. In addition, \u201cWelcome To New York\u201d was used in tourism ads for the city that served as the track\u2019s inspiration.\n\nIn addition to the standard, 13-song album, Swift teamed up with Target for an extended deluxe release, featuring three new songs and three voice memos from her writing sessions. A karaoke version of the album was also released for both the standard and the deluxe edition.\n\nIn May 2015, Swift kicked off the album\u2019s tour, sponsored by American Express. It became the highest-grossing U.S. tour of all time, earning over $250 million, and Swift later broke her own record with 2018\u2019s reputation Stadium Tour."

Rumors fly\nAnd I know you heard about me\nSo, hey, let's be friends\nI'm dying to see how this one ends\nGrab your passport and my hand\nI can make the bad guys good for a weekend\n\n[Chorus]\nSo it's gonna be forever\nOr it's gonna go down in flames?\nYou can tell me when it's over, mm\nIf the high was worth the pain\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\n'Cause you know I love the players\nAnd you love the game\n'Cause we're young and we're reckless\nWe'll take this way too far\nIt'll leave you breathless, mm\nOr with a nasty scar\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\nBut I've got a blank space, baby\nAnd I'll write your name\n\n[Verse 2]\nCherry lips, crystal skies\nI could show you incredible things\nStolen kisses, pretty lies\nYou're the king, baby, I'm your queen\nFind out what you want\nBe that girl for a month\nWait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no\nScreaming, crying, perfect storms\nI can make all the tables turn\nRose garden filled with thorns\nKeep you second guessing, like\n\"Oh, my God, who is she?\"\nI get drunk on jealousy\nBut you'll come back each time you leave\n'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream\n\n[Chorus]\nSo it's gonna be forever\nOr it's gonna go down in flames?\nYou can tell me when it's over, mm\nIf the high was worth the pain\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\n'Cause you know I love the players\nAnd you love the game\n'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)\nWe'll take this way too far\nIt'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm\nOr with a nasty scar\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)\nBut I've got a blank space, baby\nAnd I'll write your name\n\n[Bridge]\nBoys only want love if it's torture\nDon't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya\nBoys only want love if it's torture\nDon't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya\n\n[Chorus]\nSo it's gonna be forever\nOr it's gonna go down in flames?\nYou can tell me when it's over (Over), mm\nIf the high was worth the pain\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)\n'Cause you know I love the players\nAnd you love the game (And you love the game)\n'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)\nWe'll take this way too far (Ooh)\nIt'll leave you breathless, mm\nOr with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar)\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\nBut I've got a blank space, baby\nAnd I'll write your name"

Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n(Are we out of the woods?)\n[Verse 2]\nLooking at it now\nLast December (Last December)\nWe were built to fall apart\nThen fall back together (Back together)\nOoh, your necklace hanging from my neck\nThe night we couldn't quite forget\nWhen we decided, we decided\nTo move the furniture so we could dance\nBaby, like we stood a chance\nTwo paper airplanes flying, flying, flying\nAnd I remember thinking\n\n[Chorus]\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n(Are we out of the woods?)\n\n[Bridge]\nRemember when you hit the brakes too soon?\nTwenty stitches in the hospital room\nWhen you started crying, baby, I did too\nBut when the sun came up, I was looking at you\nRemember when we couldn't take the heat?\nI walked out, I said, \"I'm setting you free\"\nBut the monsters turned out to be just trees\nWhen the sun came up, you were looking at me\nYou were looking at me, oh\nYou were looking at me\n(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)\n(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)\nI remember\n(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)\n(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good)\nOh, I remember\n\n[Chorus]\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah)\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Say, are we?)\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Clear yet? Good)\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Do you remember?)\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet?

    "lyrics": "Prologue\"These songs were once about my life. They are now about yours.\"\n\nI was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on December 13, 1989.\n\nIn the world we live in, much is said about when we are born and when we die. Our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world. And a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it. But lately I've been wondering... what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death? The moments when we are reborn...\n\nThe debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all I ever do is change. All I ever do is learn from my mistakes so I don't make the same ones again. Then I make new ones. I know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day. Every day I wake up as someone slightly new. Isn't it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new?\n\nFor the last few years, I've woken up every day not wanting, but needing to write a new style of music. I needed to change the way I told my stories and the way they sounded. I listened to a lot of music from the decade in which I was born and I listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling. I was also writing a different storyline than I'd ever told you before.\n\nI wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world, the city I had always been overwhelmed by... until now. I think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on New York and all its blaring truth. I wrote about the thrill I got when I finally learned that love, to some extent, is just a game of cat and mouse. I wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle. There is no \"riding off into the sunset,\" like I used to imagine. We are never out of the woods, because we are always going to be fighting for something. I wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever, and how some feelings never go out of style. I wrote about an important lesson I learned recently... that people can say whatever they want about me, but they can't make me lose my mind. I've learned how to shake things off.\n\nI've told you my stories for years now. Some have been about coming of age. Some have been about coming undone. This is a story about coming into your own, and as a result... coming alive.\n\nI hope you know that you've given me the courage to change. I hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be, and that whispers behind your back don't define you. You are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for.\n\nFrom the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to New York or find happiness in a world where she is not in love...\n\nLove, Taylor1.
