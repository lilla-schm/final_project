 "description_preview": "Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version) is the third re-recorded album by Taylor Swift, which she created in order to regain ownership of her catalog from 2006 to 2017. The record was released on July 7, 2023.\n\nOn October 21, 2022, Swift released her tenth studio album, Midnights, with one of the promotional singles being \u201cBejeweled,\u201d the album\u2019s ninth track. The music video for this song contained a lot of easter-eggs which suggested that the next re-recording Swift was going to release would be of her third studio album, Speak Now, including orchestra versions of both \u201cEnchanted\u201d and \u201cLong Live.\u201d\n\nBefore releasing the full-length album, Swift released four songs on March 17, 2023, the same day as the opening show for her The Eras Tour. However, out of these four, only one was a part of the Speak Now album, this being \u201cIf This Was a Movie (Taylor\u2019s Version).\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s cover and release date were announced on May 5, 2023, during Swift\u2019s first Nashville show for The Eras Tour.\n\nOn June 5, 2023, Taylor revealed the full tracklist through social media posts. The tracklist includes six vault tracks + collaborations with Hayley Williams of Paramore and Fall Out Boy.",

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nWe're gonna make it now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nAnd I can see it (Yeah, yeah)\nI can see it now"

Tell me, how's your family?\nI haven't seen them in a while\nYou've been good, busier than ever\nWe small talk, work and the\u205fweather\nYour\u205fguard\u205fis up and\u205fI know why\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBecause\u205fthe last time you saw me\nIs still burned in the back of your mind\nYou gave me roses and I left them there to die\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, this is me swallowing my pride\nStandin' in front of you sayin', \"I'm sorry for that night\"\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you\nWishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI go back to December, turn around and make it alright\nI go back to December all the time\n\n[Verse 2]\nThese days, I haven't been sleeping\nStayin' up, playing back myself leavin'\nWhen your birthday passed and I didn't call\nThen I think about summer, all the beautiful times\nI watched you laughin' from the passenger side\nAnd realized I loved you in the fall\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd then the cold came, the dark days\nWhen fear crept into my mind\nYou gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, this is me swallowing my pride\nStandin' in front of you, sayin', \"I'm sorry for that night\"\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you\nWishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\n\n[Bridge]\nI miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile\nSo good to me, so right\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\nThe first time you ever saw me cry\nMaybe this is wishful thinkin'\nProbably mindless dreaming\nBut if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right\nI'd go back in time and change it, but I can't\nSo, if the chain is on your door, I understand\n\n[Chorus]\nBut this is me swallowing my pride\nStandin' in front of you, sayin', \"I'm sorry for that night\"\nAnd I go back to December\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you\nWishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI go back to December, turn around and make it alright\nI go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\n\n[Outro]\nAll the time"

Yeah\nI don't know what to say since th\u0435 twist of fate\nWhen it all broke down\nAnd th\u0435 story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nNext chapter\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow'd we end up this way?\nSee me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin\u2019 to look busy\nAnd you're doin' your best to avoid me\nI'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us\nHow I was losin' my mind when I saw you here\nBut you held your pride like you should've held me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, I'm scared to see the ending\nWhy are we pretending this is nothin'?\nI'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how\nI've never heard silence quite this loud\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I'm standin' alone in a crowded room\nAnd we're not speakin'\nAnd I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you\nLike it's killin' me? Yeah\nI don't know what to say since the twist of fate\nWhen it all broke down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\n\n[Bridge]\nThis is looking like a contest\nOf who can act like they care less\nBut I liked it better when you were on my side\nThe battle's in your hands now\nBut I would lay my armor down\nIf you said you'd rather love than fight\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo many things that you wish I knew\nBut the story of us might be ending soon\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I'm standin' alone in a crowded room\nAnd we're not speakin'\nAnd I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you\nLike it's killin' me? Yeah\nAnd I don't know what to say since the twist of fate\nWhen it all broke down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now\nAnd we're not speakin'\nAnd I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you\nLike it's killin' me? Yeah\nI don't know what to say since the twist of fate\n'Cause we're goin' down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\n\n[Outro]\nThe end"

Come on)\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's not a saint and she's not what you think (No)\nShe's an actress, woah (You know that you deserve this)\nHe was a moth to the flame\nShe was holding the matches, woah\nSoon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys\nOn the playground won't make you many friends\nShe should keep in mind, she should keep in mind\nThere is nothing I do better than revenge\n\n[Outro]\n(Come on) Do you still feel like you know what you're doin'?\n'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)\nDo you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)\nI don't think you do, I don't think you do\nLet's hear the applause (Come on, come on)\nCome on, show me how much better you are (Oh, oh)\n(So much better, yeah?)\nSo you deserve some applause\n'Cause you're so much better\nShe took him faster than you could say \"Sabotage\""

Promise me this\nThat you'll stand by me forever\nBut if, God forbid, fate should step in\nAnd force us into a goodbye\nIf you have children some day\nWhen they point to the pictures\nPlease, tell 'em my name\nTell 'em how the crowds went wild\nTell 'em how I hope they shine\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nI had the time of my life with you\n\n[Chorus]\nLong, long live the walls we crashed through\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\nAnd I was screaming, \"Long live all the magic we made\"\nAnd bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid\nSinging, \"Long live all the mountains we moved\"\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\nAnd long, long live that look on your face\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nOne day, we will be remembered"

Baby, if you only knew\nThat I can see you\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI-I-I-I\n\n[Bridge]\nI can see you in your suit and your necktie\nPassed me a note sayin\u2019, \"Meet me tonight\"\nThen we kiss and you know I won't ever tell, yeah\nAnd I could see you being my addiction\nYou can see me as a secret mission\nHide away and I will start behaving myself\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI-I-I-I\nOh-oh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nI can see you waitin' down the hall from me\nAnd I could see you up against the wall with me\nAnd what would you do?

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMy cards are on the table, yours are in your hand\nChances are, tonight, you've already got plans\nAnd chances are I will talk myself to sleep again\nYou give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high\nWishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right\nAnd I will block out these voices of reason in my head\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd the voices say, \"You are not the exception\nYou will never learn your lesson\"\n\n[Chorus]\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will take the long way, you will take the long way down\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou know how to keep me waitin'\nI know how to act like I'm fine\nDon't know what to call this situation\nBut I know I can't call you mine\nAnd it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof\n'Cause when my head is on your shoulder\nIt starts thinkin' you'll come around\nAnd maybe, someday, when we're older\nThis is something we'll laugh about\nOver coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut then the voices say, \"You are not the exception\nYou will never learn your lesson\"\n\n[Chorus]\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will take the long way, you will take the long way down\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out\n\n[Bridge]\nNow I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands\nSayin', \"How could I not see the signs?\"\nOh, you haven't written me or called\nBut goodbye screamin' in the silence\nAnd the voices in my head are tellin' me why\n'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings\nI'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring\nAnd you will say you had the best of intentions\nAnd maybe I will finally learn my lesson\n\n[Chorus]\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will take the long way, you will take the long way down\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh\n\n[Outro]\nLa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh\nLa-la-la-la-la\nAin't never gonna come\nOoh, you will learn the hard way now\nFoolish one\nSittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love\nThey ain't never gonna come\nAnd thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out\nFoolish one\nThe day is gonna come for your confessions of love\nWhen all is said and done, he just wasn't the one\nNo, he just wasn't the one"

    "lyrics": "PrologueWhen I think back on the Speak Now album, I get a lump in my throat. I have a feeling it will always be that way, because this period of time was so vibrantly aglow with the last light of the setting sun of my childhood. I made this album, completely self-written, between the ages of 18 and 20. I've spoken about how I feel like those ages are the most emotionally turbulent ones in a person's life. Maybe when I say that, I'm really just talking about myself.\n\nI think they might just be the most idealistic, hop\u0435ful years too. At this point in my life, I had rel\u0435ased my second album, Fearless, it became the breakthrough moment I'd always dreamt of, one that catapulted my career to new realms of success. It had brought with it tidal wave of premises and pitfalls and growing pains. All the while, I was encountering the milestones and checkpoints of normal teenage growth. I had cataclysmic crushes and brushes with heartache, I moved out of my parents' house and set my bags down in a new apartment, I hung photos on my walls and decorated the space where I would sob and cackle and chatter and dream. Sometimes I feel like a grown up, but a lot of the time I just wanted to time travel back to my childhood bed, where my mom would read stories to me until I fell asleep.\n\nIn my darker moments, I was tormented by the doubt that swirled loudly around my ascent and my merits as an artist. I was trying to create a follow up to the most awarded country album in history, while staring directly into the face of intense criticism. I had been widely and publicly slammed for my singing voice and was first encountering the infuriating question that is unfortunately still lobbed at me to this day: does she really write her songs?\nSpoiler alert: I really, really do.\n\nIn the years since, I've developed a thicker skin about public criticism and the cynicism with which some people approach the music I make. At that time, it leveled me. I had these voices in my head telling me that I had the perfect chance and I blew it. I hadn't been good enough, I had given it all and been found wanting.\n\nI wanted to get better, to challenge myself, and to build on my skills as a writer, an artist, and a performer. I didn't want to just be handed respect and acceptance in my field, I wanted to earn it. To try and confront these demons, I underwent extensive vocal training and made a decision that would completely define the album: I decided I would write it entirely on my own. I figured, they couldn't give all the credit to my cowriters if there weren't any. But that posed a new challenge: It really had to be good. If it wasn't, it would be proving my critics right.\n\nI had no idea how much this pain would change me. That this was the beginning of my series of creative choices made by reacting to setbacks with defiance. That my stubbornness in the face of doubters and dissenters would become my coping mechanism through my entire career from that point forward. This exact pattern of enacting my own form of rebellion when I feel broken is exactly why you're reading these very words, and I'm re-releasing this album now.\n\nI went through my first worldwide scandal (the mic-grab seen around the world). I experienced the weirdness of trying to get to know a boy while a swarm of paparazzi surrounds the car. Media contacting my publicist for an official statement on why two teenagers broke up. These are weird experiences to have at any age, but even more surreal when you're 19.\n\nI had the nagging sense that in the most intense moments of my life, I had frozen. I had said nothing publicly, I still don't know if it was an instinct, not wanting to seem impolite, or just ofmverwhelming fear. But I made sure to say it all in these songs. I decided to call the album Speak Now. It was a play on the \"speak now or forever hold your peace\" moment in weddings, but for me it symbolized a chance to respond to the chatter and commentary around my own life.\n\nSome of these emotional revelations were surprising to people. Some expected anger and instead got compassion and empathy with \"Innocent.\" Some expected a kiss of breakup song but instead got a hand-on-heart apology, \"Back to December.\" It was an album that was the most precious to me because of its vast extremes. It was unfiltered and potent. In my mind, the saddest song I've ever written is \"Last Kiss.\" My most scathing is \"Dear John\" and my most wistfully romantic is \"Enchanted.\"\n\nI'll be forever proud of setting a goal and seeing it through. I'll always feel shivers all over when I remember singing \"Long Live\" to close the show every night on tour. The outstretched hands of those bright and beautiful faces of the fans. Their support was like an open palm that reached out and helped me up off the ground when others were, frankly, mean.\n\nThese days I make my choices for those people who thought I had been good enough all along. I try to speak my mind when I feel strongly in the moment I feel it. I'm still idealistic and earnest about the music I make, but I'm less crushed when people mock me for it. I know now that one of the bravest things a person can do is create something with unblinking sincerity, to put it all on the line. I still sometimes wish I was a little kid again in a tiny bed before I ever grew up.\n\nI always looked at this album as my album, and the lump in my throat expands to a quivering voice as I say this. Thanks to you, dear reader, it finally will be.\n\nI consider this music to be, along with your faith in me, the best thing that's ever been mine.\nYours,\nTaylor"
