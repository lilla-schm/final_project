 "description_preview": "Taylor Swift\u2019s third studio album saw her sending several messages to former partners, as well as the media, a first for her career. As she explained in the liner notes, Swift sees the songs as \u201copen letters\u201d to those she loves, those who hurt her, and those who she hurt.\n\nSwift wrote each song on the album, aside from the deluxe track \u201cIf This Was a Movie,\u201d by herself. She originally claimed it was because there were no co-writers around while she was on her Fearless Tour in 2009, but she revealed to TIME in 2014 that she did this to fend off critics who thought she used ghostwriters or that her co-writers wrote most of the lyrics.\n\nAccording to Scott Borchetta, the founder of Big Machine Records, Swift originally wanted to name the album Enchanted, after the album\u2019s ninth track. Borchetta argued that this was counterproductive, since this record showcased her maturation and growth as an artist. She changed the title to Speak Now to mirror her honesty throughout the project.\n\nSpeak Now debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling over 1.047 million copies in its first week.\n\nSwift teamed up with Target to release a deluxe edition with three exclusive tracks: \u201cOurs,\u201d \u201cIf This Was a Movie,\u201d and \u201cSuperman.\u201d",

(Hold on)\nYes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on)\nYes, yes, I can see it\nYes, yes, I can see it now"

Tell me, how's your family?\nI haven't seen them in a while\nYou've been good, busier than ever\nWe small talk, work and the weather\nYour guard is up and I know why\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBecause the last time you saw me\nIs still burned in the back of your mind\nYou gave me roses and I left them there to die\n\n[Chorus]\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\nStandin' in front of you sayin', \"I'm sorry for that night\"\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you\nWishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI go back to December, turn around and make it alright\nI go back to December all the time\n\n[Verse 2]\nThese days, I haven't been sleeping\nStayin' up, playing back myself leavin'\nWhen your birthday passed and I didn't call\nThen I think about summer, all the beautiful times\nI watched you laughing from the passenger side\nAnd realized I loved you in the fall\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd then the cold came, the dark days\nWhen fear crept into my mind\nYou gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye\n\n[Chorus]\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\nStandin' in front of you, sayin', \"I'm sorry for that night\"\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you\nWishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\n\n[Bridge]\nI miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile\nSo good to me, so right\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\nThe first time you ever saw me cry\nMaybe this is wishful thinkin'\nProbably mindless dreaming\nBut if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right\nI'd go back in time and change it, but I can't\nSo, if the chain is on your door, I understand\n\n[Chorus]\nBut this is me swallowing my pride\nStandin' in front of you, sayin', \"I'm sorry for that night\"\nAnd I go back to December\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you\nWishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI go back to December, turn around and make it alright\nI go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\n\n[Outro]\nAll the time"

Yeah\nI don't know what to say since the twist of fate\nWhen it all broke down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nNext chapter\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow'd we end up this way?\nSee me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy\nAnd you're doin' your best to avoid me\nI'm starting to think, one day, I'll tell the story of us\nHow I was losing my mind when I saw you here\nBut you held your pride like you should've held me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, I'm scared to see the ending\nWhy are we pretending this is nothin'?\nI'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how\nI've never heard silence quite this loud\n\n[Chorus]\nNow, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room\nAnd we're not speakin'\nAnd I'm dyin' to know\nIs it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah\nI don't know what to say since the twist of fate\nWhen it all broke down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\n\n[Bridge]\nThis is lookin' like a contest\nOf who can act like they care less\nBut I liked it better when you were on my side\nThe battle's in your hands now\nBut I would lay my armor down\nIf you said you'd rather love than fight\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo many things that you wish I knew\nBut the story of us might be ending soon\n\n[Chorus]\nNow, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room\nAnd we're not speakin'\nAnd I'm dyin' to know\nIs it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah\nAnd I don't know what to say since the twist of fate\nWhen it all broke down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now\nAnd we're not speakin'\nAnd I'm dyin' to know\nIs it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah\nI don't know what to say since the twist of fate\n'Cause we're going down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\n\n[Outro]\nThe end"

(No)\nI don't think you do, I don't think you do\nLet's hear the applause (Come on, come on)\nCome on, show me how much better you are\n(So much better, yeah?)\nSee, you deserve some applause\n'Cause you're so much better\nShe took him faster than you could say \"Sabotage\""

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI said, \"Remember this moment\"\nIn the back of my mind\nThe time we stood with our shaking hands\nThe crowds in stands went wild\nWe were the kings and the queens\nAnd they read off our names\nThe night you danced like you knew our lives\nWould never be the same\nYou held your head like a hero\nOn a history book page\nIt was the end of a decade\nBut the start of an age\n\n[Chorus]\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\nI was screaming, \"Long live all the magic we made\"\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nOne day, we will be remembered\n\n[Verse 2]\nI said, \"Remember this feeling\"\nI pass the pictures around\nOf all the years that we stood there on the sidelines\nWishing for right now\nWe are the kings and the queens\nYou traded your baseball cap for a crown\nWhen they gave us our trophies\nAnd we held them up for our town\nAnd the cynics were outraged\nScreaming, \"This is absurd\"\n'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves\nIn ripped up jeans got to rule the world\n\n[Chorus]\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\nI was screaming, \"Long live all the magic we made\"\nAnd bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid\nLong live all the mountains we moved\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\nI was screaming, \"Long live that look on your face\"\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nOne day, we will be remembered\n\n[Bridge]\nHold on to spinning around\nConfetti falls to the ground\nMay these memories break our fall\nWill you take a moment? Promise me this\nThat you'll stand by me forever\nBut if, God forbid, fate should step in\nAnd force us into a goodbye\nIf you have children some day\nWhen they point to the pictures\nPlease, tell 'em my name\nTell 'em how the crowds went wild\nTell 'em how I hope they shine\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nI had the time of my life with you\n\n[Chorus]\nLong, long live the walls we crashed through\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\nAnd I was screaming, \"Long live all the magic we made\"\nAnd bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid\nSinging, \"Long live all the mountains we moved\"\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\nAnd long, long live that look on your face\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nOne day, we will be remembered"
