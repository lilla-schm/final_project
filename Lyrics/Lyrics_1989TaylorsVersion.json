 "description_preview": "1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) is the fourth of the six re-recorded albums on Taylor Swift\u2019s mission to regain ownership over her catalogue from 2006 to 2017. It was released on October 27, 2023, the same date as the original album.\n\nOn September 17, 2021, Swift released \u201cWildest Dreams (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d as a response of the 2014 version of the track becoming a trend on social media, especially on TikTok, making it the first song of the album to be released. She followed that with the release of \u201cThis Love (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d on May 6, 2022, as part of the soundtrack on Prime Video\u2019s series, The Summer I Turned Pretty, making it officially the second re-recorded track on 1989 to see the light of day.\n\nOn July 29, 2022, Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson posted a snippet of \u201cBad Blood (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d teased in the DC League of Super-Pets film, further hinting at 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u2019s release. However, the song never came out prior the album\u2019s release.\n\nSwift officially announced the record\u2019s release date on August 9, 2023, during the closing night of the first US leg of her The Eras Tour. In an Instagram post, she also revealed that this was her favorite re-recording and it would have five additional songs, also known as \u201cFrom The Vault\u201d tracks. Additionally, being released on October 27, 2023, 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u2019s release date is exactly nine years after the original version of the album came out in 2014, making it Swift\u2019s first re-recorded album to come out on the exact day and month as its first version.\n\nOn September 19, 2023, Swift collaborated with Google and fans across the globe had to solve different crosswords 33 million times in order to have access to the name of four \u201cFrom The Vault\u201d tracks on 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version). Fans were able to solve those crosswords in one day and, on September 20th, the title of those tracks were revealed. However, fans still don\u2019t have access to the title of one song, and, on September 20, 2023, Taylor Nation posted a different crossword for them to try to figure out the title of the last \u201cFrom The Vault\u201d track.",

If you see me working here, that means I\u2019m most likely editing metadata or adding Q&A from artist interviews!\nApart from music, I\u2019m really passionate about helping the Earth and am an aspiring doctor, competitive chess player, and a (really bad) cross-country runner \ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\n\n\n\nFavorite artists (order in when I got into them):\n- Britney Spears (#10 scholar \ud83e\udd29)\n- Camila Cabello (#42 scholar \ud83e\udd29)\n- Ariana Grande\n- Charlie Puth\n- TXT  (thanks to my best friend \ud83d\udc9e)\n- Tate McRae (#8 scholar \ud83e\udd29)\n\nOther artists I like (order in when I found them): Olivia Rodrigo, Dua Lipa, Shawn Mendes, Sabrina Carpenter (#22 scholar \ud83e\udd29), Joshua Bassett (#37 scholar \ud83e\udd29), Doja Cat, Miley Cyrus (#19 scholar \ud83e\udd29)\n\n\n\nHistory:\nI joined in late November 2021 but became active in March 2022, reaching my first milestone (1,000 IQ) in early April! I\u2019ve unfortunately been largely inactive since September 2022 but it meant the world to me to have the Genius community to socialize and connect with other music lovers \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70",

Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n(Are we out of the woods?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nLooking at it now\nLast December (Last December)\nWe were built to fall apart\nAnd fall back together (Back together)\nOoh, your necklace hanging from my neck\nThe night we couldn't quite forget\nWhen we decided, we decided\nTo move the furniture so we could dance\nBaby, like we stood a chance\nTwo paper airplanes flying, flying, flying\nAnd I remember thinkin'\n\n[Chorus]\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh)\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n(Are we out of the woods?)\n\n[Bridge]\nRemember when you hit the brakes too soon?\nTwenty stitches in the hospital room\nWhen you started crying, baby, I did too\nBut when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you\nRemember when we couldn't take the heat?\nI walked out, I said, \"I'm settin' you free\"\nBut the monsters turned out to be just trees\nWhen the sun came up, you were lookin' at me\nYou were lookin' at me, oh, you were looking at me\n(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)\n(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)\nI remember\n(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)\n(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good)\nOh, I remember\n\n[Chorus]\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah)\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Say, are we?)\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Clear yet? Good)\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Do you remember?)\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good"

Is it?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWh\u0435n you lost control (Uh-huh)\nRed blood, white snow (Uh-huh)\nBlue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)\nYour new girl is my clone\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd did you think I didn't see you?\nThere were flashin' lights\nAt least I had the decency\nTo keep my nights out of sight\nOnly rumors 'bout my hips and thighs\nAnd my whispered sighs\nOh, Lord, I think about jumpin'\nOff of very tall somethings\nJust to see you come runnin'\nAnd say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)\nIf she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)\nYou dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)\nYou search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nWas it over when she laid down on your couch?\nWas it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?\n\"Come here,\" I whispered in your ear\nIn your dream as you passed out, baby\nWas it over then? And is it over now?\n[Post-Chorus]\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it?)\n\n[Bridge]\nThink I didn't see you?\nThere were flashin' lights\nAt least I had the decency\nTo keep my nights out of sight\nOnly rumors 'bout my hips and thighs\nAnd my whispered sighs\nOh, Lord, I think about jumpin'\nOff of very tall somethings\nJust to see you come runnin' (Runnin')\nAnd say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n\n[Outro]\n(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)\nLet's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)\n(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there\nAnd say the one thing (Oh, Lord)\nI've been wanting (Oh, Lord)\nBut no\n(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)"

    "lyrics": "PrologueWhen I was 24 I sat in a backstage dressing room in London, buzzing with anticipation. My backup singers and bandmates gathered around me in a scattered circle. Scissors emerged and I watched in the mirror as my locks of long curly hair fell in piles on the floor. There I was in my plaid button down shirt, grinning sheepishly as my tour mates and friends cheered on my haircut. This simple thing that everyone does. But I had a secret. For me, it was more than a change of hairstyle. When I was 24, I decided to completly reinvent mys\u0435lf.\n\nHow does a person reinv\u0435nt herself, you ask? In any way I could think of. Musically, geographically, aesthetically, behaviorally, motivationally... And I did so joyfully. The curiosity I had felt the first murmurs of while making Red amplified into a pulsing heartbeat of restlessness in my ears. The risks I took when I toyed with pop sounds and sensibilities on Red? I wanted to push it further. The sense of freedom I felt when traveling to big bustling cities? I wanted to live in one. The voices that had begun to shame me in new ways for dating like a normal young woman? I wanted to silence them.\n\nYou see\u2014in the years preceding this, I had become the target of slut-shaming\u2014the intensity and relentlessness of which would be criticized and called out if it happened today, the jokes about my amount of boyfriends. The trivialization of my songwriting as if it were a predatory act of a boy crazy psychopath, the media co-signing of this narrative. I had to make it stop because it was starting to really hurt.\n\nIt became clear to me that for me there was no such thing as casual dating, or even having a male friend who you platonically hang out with. If I was seen with him, it was assumed I was sleeping with him. And so I swore off hanging out with guys, dating, flirting, or anything that could be weaponized against me by a culture that claimed to believe in liberating women but consistently treated me with the harsh moral codes of the Victorian Era.\n\nBeing a consummate optimist, I assumed I could fix this if I simply changed my behavior. I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships. If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn\u2019t sensationalize or sexualize that\u2014right? I would learn later on that people could and people would.\n\nBut none of that mattered then because I had a plan and I had a demeanor as trusting as a basket of golden retriever puppies. I had the keys to my own apartment in New York and I had new melodies bursting from my imagination. I had Max Martin and Shellback who were happy to help me explore this new sonic landscape I was enamored with. I had a new friend named Jack Antonoff who had made some cool tracks in his apartment. I had the idea that the album would be called 1989 and we would reference big 80s synths and write sky high choruses. I had sublime, inexplicable faith and I ran right toward it, in high heels and a crop top.\n\nThere was so much that I didn't know then, and looking back I see what a good thing that was. This time of my life was marked by right kind of na\u00efvet\u00e9, a hunger for adventure, and a sense of freedom I hadn't tasted before. It turns out that the cocktail of na\u00efvet\u00e9, hunger for adventure and freedom can lead to some nasty hangovers, metaphorically speaking. Of course everyone had something to say, but they always will. I learned lessons, paid prices, and tried to... Don't say it... Don't say it... I'm sorry, I have to say it... Shake it off.\n\nI'll always be so incredibly grateful for how you loved and embraced this album. You, who followed my zig zag creative choices and cheered on my risks and experiments. You, who heard the wink and humor in \"Blank Space\" and maybe even empathized with the pain behind the satire. You, who saw the seeds of allyship and advocating for equality in \"Welcome To New York.\" You, who knew that maybe a girl who surrounds herself with female friends in adulthood is making up for a lack of them in the childhood (Not starting a tyrannical hot girl cult). You, who saw that I reinvent myself for a million reasons, and that one of them is to try my very best to entertain you. You, who have had the grace to allow me the freedom to change.\n\nI was born in 1989, reinvented for the first time in 2014, and a part of me was reclaimed in 2023 with the re-release of this album I love so dearly. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine the magic you would sprinkle on my life for so long.\n\nThis moment is a reflection of the woods we've wandered through and all this love between us still glowing in the darkest dark.\n\nI present to you, with gratitude and wild wonder, my version of 1989.\n\nIt's been waiting for you.\nTaylor"
